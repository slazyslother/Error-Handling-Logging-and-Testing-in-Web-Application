# Error Handling, Logging, and Testing in Web Application

This project involves enhancing a C++ web application by adding comprehensive error handling, implementing logging functionality, setting up alerts for critical errors using a monitoring tool, and incorporating testing to ensure the reliability and stability of the system.


<br/>

## Features

- __Comprehensive Error Handling__: Implement mechanisms to handle exceptions, errors, and unexpected behavior gracefully.
- __Logging__: Integrate a logging library to record application events, errors, warnings, and debug information.
- __Alerts for Critical Errors__: Configure alerts and notifications for critical errors using a monitoring tool to ensure prompt response and resolution.
- __Centralized Logging__: Direct logs to a centralized location for easy monitoring, analysis, and troubleshooting.
- __Error Response Formats__: Define standardized error response formats to convey error details and context to clients.
<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Exception Handling__: Use try-catch blocks or exception handling mechanisms to catch and handle errors and exceptions.
- __Logging Configuration__: Configure logging levels, formats, destinations, and rotation policies using the selected logging library.
- __Alert Configuration__: Set up alerts and notifications for critical errors using the monitoring tool's configuration interface.
- __Error Monitoring__: Monitor error rates, trends, and patterns to identify potential issues and improve application reliability.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Error Handling Mechanisms__: Implement error handling logic to catch and handle exceptions, errors, and unexpected behavior gracefully. Use appropriate error codes, messages, and context information.
- __Logging Integration__: Integrate a logging library (e.g., Log4cpp, Boost.Log) into the application codebase. Configure loggers to capture errors, warnings, debug information, and custom log messages.
- __Monitoring Tool Integration__: Configure the monitoring tool to receive alerts and notifications for critical errors. Set up thresholds, triggers, and escalation policies to ensure timely response and resolution.
- __Error Response Formats__: Define standardized error response formats with clear error codes, messages, details, and HTTP status codes. Ensure consistency across all error responses.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Automated Testing__: Write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate error handling, logging, and alerting functionalities.
- __Test Scenarios__: Test various scenarios, including error conditions, logging outputs, and alert notifications.
- __Framework__: Utilize testing frameworks like Google Test or Catch2 for writing and executing tests.
- __Coverage Analysis__: Perform code coverage analysis to ensure that all error handling, logging, and alerting functionalities are adequately tested.
  
<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Exception Handling__: Simulate exceptions and errors in the application code and verify that they are caught and handled appropriately using try-catch blocks or exception handling mechanisms.
- __Logging Configuration__: Log various types of events, errors, warnings, and debug information using different logging levels. Verify that logs are written to the specified destinations and adhere to the configured logging policies.
- __Alert Setup__: Trigger critical errors in the application and verify that alerts are generated and sent to the appropriate recipients through the monitoring tool. Test the alerting mechanism under different scenarios and validate the response time.
- __Error Response Formats__: Send requests with invalid input or trigger known error scenarios and verify that the application responds with standardized error responses containing relevant error details and context information.
